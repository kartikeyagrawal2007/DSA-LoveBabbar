# DSA Practice in C++ 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using C++.  
It is part of my personal learning journey to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen core concepts, and build a strong programming foundation.

## 📚 Source of Questions

The problems are inspired by various DSA preparation sheets available online, including the popular [450 DSA Cracker Sheet by Love Babbar](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/450-dsa-cracker-sheet-love-babbar/).

## ✅ What's Included

- 🔢 Basic C++ programs to refresh syntax (if-else, loops, number ops)
- 🧠 Logic-building questions solved step-by-step
- ✍️ Well-structured and named `.cpp` files for each problem
- 📁 Organized by problem type (planned as the repo grows)

## 🛠️ Language Used

- **C++**
  - Compiled using `g++` via VS Code
  - Input/output via terminal
